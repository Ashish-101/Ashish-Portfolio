I also hold a degree in Environmental Engineering from Kathmandu University, Nepal. I believe my strong side is problem solving whether its a GIS, Anaytical or  programming problem. On my free time I love to code and learn about new technologies, recently I built my own custom computer by researching various parts to optimise and build a perfect setup for my day to day tasks.        This website is one of my side projects to learn web development, Thank you for visiting! and Please feel free to contact me through email or linkedin!",

My coursework has provided me with in-depth knowledge of project scheduling, cost estimation, risk management, contract administration, and sustainable building practices. I have gained hands-on experience using industry-standard software such as Microsoft Project, AutoCAD, Excel, and Bluebeam Revu to effectively manage construction workflows. Additionally, I have worked on projects involving building code compliance, procurement strategies, and stakeholder coordination, enhancing my ability to oversee projects from conception to completion. Most importantly, my experience has strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment, ensuring effective communication and coordination to achieve project goals successfully.",

My experience includes processing and analyzing raster and vector data to derive meaningful insights for decision-making, creating cartographically accurate figures and thematic maps to effectively visualize spatial relationships, and designing and managing geodatabases to ensure data integrity and seamless integration of spatial datasets. Additionally, I developed an interactive web map using ArcGIS Online and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, demonstrating my proficiency in GIS-driven web applications. I also worked with spatial databases, using SQL to store, query, and manipulate GIS data efficiently.  :)",
